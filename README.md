- Crisis hotline

## Sawyer's Story
Sawyer, a Developer on this project, was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder 1 at the age of 15. After years of relearning how to take care of himself and his diagnosis he was able to get his life back on track. But not everyone has the support system he had. That's what drove him to design Solace. Personalized guided meditation is one of the features Sawyer envisioned, since meditation was a core part of his journey.

## Change the Environment  
Solace takes a unique approach to mental health recovery. Instead of diagnosing and treating the condition, it is designed to help with creating a better environment to allow growth and development.

Upon opening Solace you fill out a questionnaire about your brain type and goals. Solace uses that information to provide tools to help with your goals, personalized to help you grow in a way that works for your mind.

Anyone can improve their lifestyle with Solace, with a design to fit each and every person.
 
Solace is made to help you manage your busy life, by providing reminders, tools, and recommendations to foster improvement.

## Nodes
While designing Solace, we realized we had an issue. How could we ensure your data stays private while still enabling seamless integration with external tools? Here's where Nodes come in.

Nodes are optional tools for bridging the world with Solace. Think of them like bonus features.

What would a Node look like? 
Let's say you install a calendar Node. This Node could make calendar reminders and edits. 
- What about a Fitness Watch? A node could connect that. 
- Want to automatically have your medication refilled? A node could call your refills in for you.
- We want to make as many as possible, so if you have any ideas, feel free to submit a request.

## Data Privacy
Data privacy is our top priority. By default, no data is stored unless you choose to opt in. From there, data remains securely stored in an encrypted library on your device, and is only sent to the server to provide context. You can view your library and delete data you don't want stored at any moment. If you would like to try out experimental features, you can enable the "Use my Data to train future models" option.

### Please note that this project is still in early development, not many features are implemented.
